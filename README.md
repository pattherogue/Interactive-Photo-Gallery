# Interactive-Photo-Gallery
Unit 05 Project

In this project, I have created an interactive photo gallery using Javascript and CSS Grid Layout. 

The top of the page has a search area where photos will hide and show depending on the user input.

Upon user click on thumnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. The "back" and "previous" arrows allow to cycle through photos.
